## Abstract

The ever-increasing number of empirical studies in many social science disciplines makes it difficult for researchers to keep track of the current state of research and contextualize new findings within existing research. Evidence gap maps, systematic reviews and meta-analyses are useful tools for creating evidence syntheses and can form the basis for evidence-based decisions in policy and science. This input talk will provide a basic introduction to various approaches, techniques, and tools of (quantitative) research synthesis. Additionally, participants will be provided with evaluation criteria how to review an evidence synthesis and shown exemplary application examples.
